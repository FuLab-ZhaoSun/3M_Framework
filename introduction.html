                <p>Omics-based technology has greatly promoted the precision medicine, which relays on the high-quality biobanks for meeting the technological requirements. However, it's still lacked the universal guidance of end-to-end management of bio-sample collections, which resulting in the serious biases for further intergraded omics analysis. This review aims to systematically conclude the bio-sample requirements of multi-omics technologies and propose a standardized framework named as "3M" (multi-omics, multimodal biospecimen, multi-departments). The 3M framework includes: (1). Multimodal biospecimen volume requirement for each omics type; (2). Standard protocols for multimodal biospecimen acquisition, transport and storage including the tissue, serum, saliva, urine and feces; (3). Ethical compliance; (4). Quality control (QC) and data management including metadata acquisition and other processes. This open-framework can be obtained from the online website (3M Framework), which contains the all related detailed information, protocols and documents, and thus makes contributed to the standard multimodal biospecimen management.</p>

                <p>Biobanks, encompassing programmatic biological materials, associated information, and legal considerations concerning data security and protection ,serve as cornerstones of biomedical research. The 1990s witnessed the emergence of biobanks, primarily disease-oriented and functionally limited . As a milestone, the Human Genome Project (HGP), initiated to comprehensively explore human genetic information, was successfully completed in 2003. Subsequently, biobanks primarily supporting genomics research emerged,yet they faced limitations in data dimensionality.Breakthroughs in high-throughput technologies facilitated the systematic integration of omics technologies (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics), enabling comprehensive analysis of cellular components (e.g., RNA, DNA) in their entirety or near-completeness .This propelled the transformation of biobanks into multi-omics data hubs, such as UK Biobank and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) . However, the variability in sample processing specifications among omics platforms complicates the integrated acquisition of biological specimens for multi-omics studies, which may result in the biases for further intergraded omics analysis.</p>
                <p>Existing multi-omics biobank reviews present limitations in accommodating multi-omics technologies and meeting associated specimen requirements-including content specifications for various specimen types, aliquot preparation, collection procedures, storage conditions, and transportation protocols-which hinders researchers' ability to establish high-quality biological sample banks that satisfy comprehensive multi-omics analytical demands.Furthermore, the concurrent collection of multiple biospecimen types from individual patients (such as tissue, blood, stool, urine, and saliva) imposes additional physical and psychological burdens on participants. These challenges collectively necessitate enhanced ethical oversight for multi-omics biobanking practices and require rigorous optimization of sampling protocols to ensure sustainable implementation.</p>

                <p>In this study, we proposed an open-framework named as "3M" (multi-omics, multimodal biospecimen, multi-departments) for multi-omics-based Biobank and applied this framework in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University to collect multimodal biospecimen from Oncologic Inpatient Cohorts. This open-framework includes the summary of multimodal biospecimen volume requirement for major omics type, the standard protocols of multimodal biospecimen collections, transport and storage, omics-based ethical compliance, quality control and data management. Moreover, we developed the online website (3M Framework) for researchers easily application.</p>
