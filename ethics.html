            <h3><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Ethical and Security Considerations</h3>
            <p>The long-term development of biobanks requires balancing scientific value with ethical compliance, with all sample and data collection conducted after obtaining informed consent from donors to protect the rights of both donors and collectors and avoid legal disputes. The signing of informed consent forms should respect the donor's wishes, religious beliefs, and cultural background, ensuring it is signed in writing under conditions of consciousness, fairness, non-coercion, and full understanding, clearly defining the rights and responsibilities of both parties, and completed and permanently stored before sample collection [99]. Despite the initial establishment of an informed consent framework, several pitfalls remain in practical application, For instance, whether the sampling process causes harm to the patient, the extent of harm, and if there is compensation? Does the patient have sufficient right to informed consent? Is the collection of samples ethical? Issues of biological sample security or data security, and privacy concerns.</p>
            <p>Based on the definition of harm in Munshi's study [100], the sampling and testing operations of the biobank do not involve actions likely to cause harm to patients, and all associated costs are borne by the biobank, not infringing upon the patient's financial interests. Secondly, after implementing the standardized collaborative operation protocol between clinical treatment and the biobank, the psychological and physical burden on patients from secondary sampling is also avoided. For this act of social contribution by donating samples to the biobank, although the ultimate research outcomes contribute to society, patients do not directly benefit from the related research, thus the biobank should still provide appropriate compensation, which helps attract more individuals to participate in donation[101]. When obtaining patient informed consent for the biobank, it is necessary to consider differences in individual comprehension abilities and age to ensure effective communication, especially for vulnerable groups, the biobank should develop easily understandable protocols, such as using plain language expressions and avoiding terminology. For patients without autonomous decision-making capacity (e.g., children), their legal guardians can sign on their behalf [102-104]. Information preserved by biobanks encompasses clinical data, biomaterial data, and demographic data. When handling data or samples containing personal privacy, donors' concerns about the exposure of private information might affect their willingness to participate. Therefore, before obtaining informed consent, it is essential to detail the biobank's de-identification protection measures for personal information to the target individuals, alleviating their concerns and enhancing their willingness to participate[105, 106]. To ensure the security of biological samples and related data, all activities of the biobank should be conducted under the strict review and supervision of an ethics committee. Particularly when involving the use of biological samples, such as exporting samples collected in China to foreign countries, there must be justifiable reasons ensuring all processes are legally compliant, and the entire process is monitored by the ethics committee [107, 108].</p>
