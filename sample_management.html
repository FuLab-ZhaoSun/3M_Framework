            <div class="sub-section">
                <h4><i class="fas fa-microscope"></i> Multimodal biospecimen collection and storage</h4>
                <p>The pre-processing of biological samples is a critical step in building a high-quality biobank, and its standardized implementation faces numerous challenges. Firstly, potential biases in sample collection can lead to systematic errors. Particularly when collecting multimodal samples from the same patient, it may increase the patient's physical and mental burden, resulting in a decreased sample acquisition rate. Secondly, the time-dependent degradation of endogenous biomolecules in separated samples severely limits the reliability of downstream analyses, necessitating quality control methods to ensure sample quality. Therefore, this study has constructed a clinical diagnosis-biobank collaborative framework, leveraging systematic strategies to overcome quality control bottlenecks.</p>
                <p>Standardized procedures based on clinical pathways are as follows: After a patient is diagnosed and admitted, they should voluntarily sign a standardized "Biological Sample Donation Informed Consent Form" under full disclosure. The sample collection time window must strictly adhere to the sequence of clinical diagnosis and treatment. For instance, at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, after a patient is diagnosed but before any therapeutic intervention, the hospital collects the initial biological sample for laboratory testing. The biobank can synchronously collect the required samples, effectively avoiding the trouble of secondary collection for the patient. Throughout the treatment cycle, the biobank needs to work closely with clinical collection to dynamically gather samples, covering the entire biospecimen spectrum from initial diagnosis to the end of treatment. The collection of various sample types needs to be prepared and pre-processed according to the type of downstream experiment. After obtaining clinical samples, it is advisable to de-identify and label the samples to protect patient personal information. Furthermore, it is recommended to collect an additional 2-3 backup samples for aliquoting, based on the aforementioned omics requirements for sample volume. Regarding sample transport, it needs to be conducted under temperature monitoring according to environmental conditions and experimental requirements. Moreover, all biological samples must undergo quality testing before being stored in the biobank, including tissue sample quality, DNA quality, RNA quality, and protein quality. This meticulous sample management plan provides reliable assurance for research and maximizes the effective utilization of samples.</p>

            <div class="sub-section sample-type">
                <h5><i class="fas fa-cut"></i> Tissue</h5>
                <p>To minimize tissue warm ischemia time, tissue samples should be collected and processed within 30 minutes of gross specimen excision.[50, 51] . The process involves rinsing the excised tissue sample with sterile, nuclease - free saline or PBS to remove surface blood. The tissue should then be dissected into smaller pieces and stored in aliquots to minimize freeze–thaw cycles. It should be noted that these tissue samples may originate from 'remnant tissue' from surgical specimens, or biopsy tissue obtained through minor surgery, endoscopy, or ultrasound guidance. The collection sequence should be: normal tissue (N: >5 cm from the tumour edge), para-cancerous tissue (P: 2–3 cm from the tumour edge), and tumour tissue (T) [52-55] .</p>
                <p>For fresh frozen samples, a sufficient amount of tissue needs to be provided, while ensuring enough material remains for pathological examination. Processed tissue samples should be stored in 2 mL RNase - free screw - cap cryovials, snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 hours, and then transferred to -80°C or liquid nitrogen for long - term storage. If immediate processing is not possible, snap - freezing should occur within approximately 3 hours of storage at 4°C. Certain omics applications require the use of preservation solutions. For example, when using RNAlater, add five times the tissue volume, store overnight at 4°C, then transfer to -80°C for applications like transcriptomic sequencing. When preserving with Miltenyi Tissue Storage Solution, add five times the tissue volume and transport to the lab at 4°C within 24 hours for applications such as single - cell sequencing. For paraffin - embedded samples, fixation with 10% buffered formalin (preferably neutral buffered formalin) should occur within approximately 3 hours of surgical removal. Fixation time is typically 24–48 hours. Embedded tissues can be stored at room temperature or 4°C.</p>

            <div class="sub-section sample-type">
                <h5><i class="fas fa-tint"></i> Blood</h5>
                <p>Blood samples should be processed as soon as possible, within 2 hours. If immediate processing is not feasible, samples should be stored at 4°C for no longer than 24 hours[56, 57].For serum or plasma, processing (centrifugation, separation, aliquoting, and freezing) must occur within 4 hours of collection. It is recommended to store processed blood samples in multiple aliquots to avoid quality degradation due to repeated freeze–thaw cycles. After collection, anticoagulant blood should be gently inverted and mixed, centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes, the plasma aliquoted into cryovials, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 h, and stored at -80°C. After collection of procoagulant blood, allow it to clot at room temperature (15–25°C) for 0.5 h [58] , centrifuge at 2000g for 10 minutes [59] , and collect the supernatant (serum). Aliquot the serum into cryovials, snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 h, and store long-term at -80°C. Discard the last 500 μl to avoid platelet and cellular contamination[60] . Blood samples exhibiting haemolysis, insoluble flocculants, or turbidity are considered unqualified, and resampling is advised.</p>
                <p>The choice of blood collection tube type should be based on experimental goals, downstream analysis requirements, and sample stability. In metabolomics, serum is considered the gold standard due to the absence of anticoagulant interference, particularly for amino acid metabolite detection. Heparin/EDTA plasma tubes can be used as alternatives, but it should be noted that heparin interferes with DNA studies and EDTA affects NMR signals [61-63] . Proteomics studies require special consideration: serum can reflect changes in coagulation-related proteins, while EDTA plasma inhibits protease activity, favouring the stability of sensitive proteins like phosphatases. Although citrate tubes reduce platelet activation, the dilution effect caused by liquid anticoagulants may affect the accuracy of protein concentration [64, 65] . For transcriptomics, PAXgene tubes (for rapid RNA stabilization) or EDTA tubes (inhibiting RNase release) are preferred; the latter is more suitable for large-scale clinical studies but requires control over sample exposure time [66] .</p>

            <div class="sub-section sample-type">
                <h5><i class="fas fa-flask"></i> Urine</h5>
                <p>Prior to collecting urine samples, donors should be instructed to thoroughly clean or disinfect the urethral opening. Post-collection, urine samples should be visually inspected to assess their suitability, specifically checking for contaminants such as faeces. Clean midstream urine should be collected from each donor in the morning before breakfast (between 5:00 and 8:00 AM) [67-69]. Samples should be centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 h, and then stored at -80°C. Samples that cannot be processed promptly should also be placed at 4°C for <48h, at room temperature (around 22°C) for <3h, avoiding transport with ice packs and at room temperature for over 8h, at -20°C for <2 weeks, with freeze-thaw cycles ≤3 times[70-73].</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section sample-type">
                <h5><i class="fas fa-smile"></i> Saliva</h5>
                <p>Saliva samples should be collected between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM [74-77] . Donors should rinse their mouths with purified water 2 hours prior to sampling to clear oral debris. Thereafter, donors should refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, or brushing their teeth. Place a sterile cotton swab under the donor's tongue, removing the saliva-soaked swab every 1 minute, repeating this four times. Subsequently, extract saliva from the cotton swabs using a disposable syringe. Samples should then be centrifuged at 2600g for 15 minutes at 4°C[78] to remove any debris. The supernatant from each sample should be aliquoted into cryovials, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 h, and stored at -80°C until use[79, 80] . Samples should be frozen as soon as possible after sampling; if freezing conditions cannot be met, storage should be at room temperature for <1h, at 2-8°C for <6h, and at -20°C for ≤4 weeks[81-83] .</p>

            <div class="sub-section sample-type">
                <h5><i class="fas fa-poop"></i> Faeces</h5>
                <p>Faeces are collected within 24 hours prior to endoscopic examination[84] . Fresh specimens are crucial. Prior to collection, instruct participants to empty their bladders and use squat toilets if possible. Collect faeces into clean, dry faecal collection tubes and transfer them to sterile containers within 30 minutes. Use a sterile spatula to collect the middle portion of the faecal sample [85]. After collection, aliquot the samples and store them at 4°C. Collected samples are snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 h and then stored at -80°C. Faecal samples should be temporarily stored at -20°C or 4°C for <8 weeks or <12h respectively [86, 87] , and at room temperature for <4h [88] .</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-clone"></i> Sample Aliquoting</h3>
            <p>The collection and processing of multi-omics samples should strictly adhere to established sample volume guidelines. To ensure the smooth progression of research, we recommend collecting an additional 2-3 portions of each sample type as backups and employing an aliquoting strategy for storage. This backup approach effectively addresses potential unforeseen incidents during sample storage, transport, or usage, such as sample degradation due to temperature fluctuations or leakage from improper handling. In the event of such occurrences, intact backup samples can be promptly utilized, preventing research delays caused by a single problematic sample and ensuring the seamless execution of the entire research workflow. This robust sample management protocol provides reliable assurance for the research and minimizes experimental risks.</p>

        <section id="transport" class="card content-section">
            <h3><i class="fas fa-truck"></i> Sample transport</h3>
            <p>Refrigerated samples (i.e., those stored at 2–8°C) require the use of biological ice packs during transport to maintain their storage temperature range. For samples requiring cryogenic preservation, dry ice or liquid nitrogen must be used for protective transport. It is recommended to store samples at 2–8°C before centrifugation and aliquoting, and freezing is not permissible[73] . When using dry ice for transport, the amount should be reasonably arranged based on the transport time: 2kg of dry ice maintains a low-temperature environment for ≤6 hours, 5kg for ≤24 hours, and 8kg for ≤48 hours, considering higher summer temperatures, the amount of dry ice should be increased to 1.5 times the original amount. To prevent dry ice from crushing and damaging samples, it is recommended to use powdered or rod-shaped dry ice; block dry ice can be crushed with a hammer before transport. Additionally, to ensure sample safety, all samples placed in dry ice should use self-sealing bags on the outer packaging and be clearly labelled for identification and tracking. It must be emphasized that to ensure the safety and integrity of the samples, transporting samples loosely placed within dry ice is strictly prohibited.</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h4><i class="fas fa-clipboard-list"></i> Sample sampling</h4>
                <p>To ensure the reliability of sample quality, it is recommended to implement stringent quality control measures throughout the entire process from sample collection to use. Reference ISO 20387(ISO 20387:2018 'General requirements for biobanking') to establish a QC system based on risk analysis is advised. Quality sampling of samples should be conducted periodically, with small batch sampling monthly (accounting for 2%-5% of the total biobank volume) and comprehensive sampling every six months (accounting for 10%-15%); targeted sampling will be promptly carried out when significant environmental changes occur in the biobank, new methods are introduced, or abnormal results appear; Detection scope covers the quality of protein, nucleic acid, and tissue samples. For samples that do not meet the standards, destruction should be carried out according to ISO 35001(ISO 35001:2019 'Biorisk management for laboratories and other related organisations'), and destruction records completed. Through regular sampling and standardized management, the integrity of samples and the reliability of research data can be effectively guaranteed, ensuring the smooth implementation of scientific research work.</p>

                <h5><i class="fas fa-ruler-combined"></i> Tissue sample quality test</h5>
                <p>Cell viability is typically measured using the Trypan Blue staining method, and a viability score of >80% is required for compliance. If the viability score falls below this threshold, appropriate techniques to remove dead cells can be considered for cell enrichment, thereby enhancing the overall viability level of the sample. However, when the tissue necrosis rate exceeds 20%-50%, the excessive proportion of dead cells may severely interfere with subsequent research or testing, and such tissues can generally be directly discarded[89, 90].</p>
                <p>For the detection of tumour cell content, H&E staining can be effectively used to assess the percentage of tumour cells within the tumour tissue. When the proportion of tumour cells in the tumour tissue is >65%[91], the sample is deemed qualified.</p>

                <h5><i class="fas fa-dna"></i> DNA quality test</h5>
                <p>The principles and procedures for DNA quality testing are similar to those for RNA quality assessment. Firstly, the concentration and purity of DNA are determined using spectrophotometry based on ultraviolet absorbance quantification methods. The absorbance ratio OD260/OD280 serves as a crucial indicator of DNA purity, with a value of 1.8 signifying a relatively pure state of DNA[90, 92, 93]. Secondly, the integrity of DNA is assessed via agarose gel electrophoresis. Intact genomic DNA exhibits tight, high-molecular-weight band characteristics during electrophoresis, with minimal or no low-molecular-weight smearing. The appearance of smearing or diffuse bands in the electrophoresis results indicates degradation or fragmentation of the DNA. This result provides a visual basis for determining whether the sample handling and storage conditions are suitable for downstream molecular experiments, thereby ensuring the quality of the DNA used.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section qc-type">
                <h5><i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i> RNA quality test</h5>
                <p>RNA quality assessment focuses on purity and integrity, both of which dictate the usability of RNA samples in biological experiments. Spectrophotometry is a key method for purity detection. Its principle relies on the characteristic absorption of nucleic acids at 260 nm and proteins at 280 nm, calculating the OD260/280 ratio to judge purity. Typically, a ratio between 1.8 and 2.2 indicates high purity of the RNA sample. However, this method cannot directly reflect RNA integrity and struggles to identify other impurities. The choice of measurement buffer is also crucial; Tris or TE buffers provide more stable OD260/280 ratios than water. To compensate for the limitations of spectrophotometry, the current trend is to adopt a multi-wavelength OD comprehensive judgment strategy covering 240 nm and 320 nm wavelengths, respectively, to capture potential contaminant and background absorption information. Analyzing the changes in OD260/240 and OD260/320 ratios allows for deeper identification of other contaminants in the sample, thereby enhancing the accuracy of RNA sample quality assessment and providing reliable support for subsequent biological experiments[90, 93].</p>
                <p>For integrity assessment, RNA Integrity Number (RIN) detection is a core tool, utilizing microfluidic capillary electrophoresis to obtain RIN values ranging from 1 (completely degraded) to 10 (fully intact). Generally, RIN ≥7 is considered a critical threshold, reflecting the overall quality of the RNA. RNA extracted from fresh tissues typically exhibits higher RIN values, whereas Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissues tend to have RIN values concentrated in the 2-5 range, affecting the success rate of RNA-seq experiments. Therefore, factors such as sample storage time, environmental conditions, and fixation time need to be considered during experimental planning to ensure the accuracy and reliability of experimental results[94-96].</p>

            <div class="sub-section qc-type">
                <h5><i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i> Protein quality test</h5>
                <p>The BCA Protein Assay Kit (using bovine serum albumin as the standard) is employed to determine protein concentration by measuring the absorbance of the sample at a specific wavelength and calculating the protein concentration based on a standard curve. In the assay, DOC and TCA can be used to precipitate proteins to eliminate interfering substances in the BCA protein assay, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of protein quantification[97]. Protein quality is assessed using the traditional Western blot method; if specific bands for the target protein can be detected, and these bands are clear without significant smearing or diffusion, it indicates that the extracted protein is not degraded and the protein quality is good[98].</p>
