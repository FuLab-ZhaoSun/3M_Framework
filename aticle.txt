Abstract 
Omics-based technology has greatly promoted the precision medicine, which relays on the high-quality biobanks for meeting the technological requirements. However, it’s still lacked the universal guidance of end-to-end management of bio-sample collections, which resulting in the serious biases for further intergraded omics analysis. This review aims to systematically conclude the bio-sample requirements of multi-omics technologies and propose a standardized framework named as “3M” (multi-omics, multimodal biospecimen, multi-departments). The 3M framework includes: (1). Multimodal biospecimen volume requirement for each omics type; (2). Standard protocols for multimodal biospecimen acquisition, transport and storage including the tissue, serum, saliva, urine and feces; (3). Ethical compliance; (4). Quality control (QC) and data management including metadata acquisition and other processes. This open-framework can be obtained from the online website (Biobank management framework), which contains the all related detailed information, protocols and documents, and thus makes contributed to the standard multimodal biospecimen management.  
1. Introduction
Biobanks, encompassing programmatic biological materials, associated information, and legal considerations concerning data security and protection [1-2],serve as cornerstones of biomedical research. The 1990s witnessed the emergence of biobanks, primarily disease-oriented and functionally limited [3-5]. As a milestone, the Human Genome Project (HGP), initiated to comprehensively explore human genetic information, was successfully completed in 2003. Subsequently, biobanks primarily supporting genomics research emerged[6-8],yet they faced limitations in data dimensionality[9].Breakthroughs in high-throughput technologies facilitated the systematic integration of omics technologies (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics), enabling comprehensive analysis of cellular components (e.g., RNA, DNA) in their entirety or near-completeness [10].This propelled the transformation of biobanks into multi-omics data hubs, such as UK Biobank and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)[11] [12]. However, the variability in sample processing specifications among omics platforms complicates the integrated acquisition of biological specimens for multi-omics studies, which may result in the biases for further intergraded omics analysis.
Existing multi-omics biobank reviews present limitations in accommodating multi-omics technologies and meeting associated specimen requirements-including content specifications for various specimen types, aliquot preparation, collection procedures, storage conditions, and transportation protocols-which hinders researchers' ability to establish high-quality biological sample banks that satisfy comprehensive multi-omics analytical demands.[13-14]Furthermore, the concurrent collection of multiple biospecimen types from individual patients (such as tissue, blood, stool, urine, and saliva) imposes additional physical and psychological burdens on participants. These challenges collectively necessitate enhanced ethical oversight for multi-omics biobanking practices and require rigorous optimization of sampling protocols to ensure sustainable implementation.
In this study, we proposed an open-framework named as “3M” (multi-omics, multimodal biospecimen, multi-departments) for multi-omics-based Biobank and applied this framework in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University to collect multimodal biospecimen from Oncologic Inpatient Cohorts. This open-framework includes the summary of multimodal biospecimen volume requirement for major omics type, the standard protocols of multimodal biospecimen collections, transport and storage, omics-based ethical compliance, quality control and data management. Moreover, we developed the online website (Biobank management framework) for researchers easily application (Figure 1).

2. Requirements for Biobank Samples in Multi-Omics Technologies
In this section, we systemically concluded the brief technologies and bio-samples requirements of five major omics types, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and epigenomics (Figure 2). If researchers who collect the aimed sample for omics-sequencing, they can obtain the detailed protocols and determine the sample volumes (Biobank management framework).

2.1. Genomics
Genomics takes the whole genome sequence and DNA variations (single nucleotide variations, insertion deletions, structural variations, etc.) as the object of study, analyses the genome structure, function and evolution, and its carrier genome consists of exons encoding proteins (accounting for 1%) and introns regulating gene expression.[15] .Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) involves DNA extraction, library preparation (fragmentation, end-repair, adapter ligation), paired-end 150bp sequencing (e.g., via Illumina platforms), and bioinformatics analysis (FastQC, BWA, GATK) [16-17]. Its paired-end strategy improves detection of repeats and SVs.Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES), which uses probes to capture exons (1% of the genome but holds 85% of disease-causing mutations), is cost-effective and less data-intensive. Its process resembles WGS, but with exon capture and enrichment in library preparation[18].For microbial studies, amplicon sequencing amplifies marker genes (16S/18S/ITS) with universal primers for community composition analysis at the genus level and above. Metagenomic sequencing directly assesses all microbial DNA in environmental samples, revealing genetic and metabolic details down to the strain level. Both involve end-repair and adapter ligation in DNA processing[19-20].

2.2. Transcriptomics
Transcriptomics, the study of all transcribed RNAs (mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, and small RNAs) in a biological organism, reveals gene expression and regulation mechanisms, reflecting a cell's specific state [21].mRNA-seq, a common technique, involves total RNA extraction, mRNA enrichment, double-stranded cDNA synthesis, end-repair, polyA addition, adapter ligation, PCR enrichment, and library quality assessment, enabling high-throughput sequencing to uncover RNA expression dynamics and structural variations[22].miRNA-seq, focusing on 20nt to 25nt small RNAs, includes RNA extraction, adapter addition, reverse transcription, PCR amplification, and library quality assessment, using SE50 sequencing to analyze miRNA expression levels and evolutionary history[23]. LncRNA-seq resolves long non-coding RNA functions by removing rRNA and retaining strand information [24].circRNA-seq constructs libraries by removing ribosomal and linear RNA, employing PE50 sequencing to analyze circular non-coding RNA differential expression and miRNA binding sites, elucidating their functional mechanisms [25-26]. Macrotranscriptome sequencing takes all RNA as the research object, and after constructing standard libraries, it is able to analyse the transcriptional situation and regulatory laws of the genome of a population in a specific environment. The amount of sequencing data usually reaches 5-10Gb, providing an important tool for the study of gene expression networks in ecosystems[27].

2.3. Proteomics
Proteomics, which uses high-throughput methods to analyze protein types, quantities, modifications, and interactions in cells or tissues, works with genomics and transcriptomics to uncover dynamic gene expression processes, crucial for understanding physiological and disease mechanisms[28].Unlabeled techniques like DIA generate secondary spectra by spectral library construction and integrate first-level signals. Combined with LC-MS/MS and tools like Spectronaut, it improves detection reliability. 4D-DIA adds ion mobility separation, enhancing scanning speed, sensitivity, and quantification accuracy[29-30].Label free uses LC- MS/MS for large-scale protein identification by analyzing proteolytic peptides. TMT enables simultaneous relative quantification of 8 or 18 samples using isotope tags, involving protein extraction, digestion, labeling, chromatographic fractionation, and LC-MS/MS detection [31-32].PRM, after pre-experimental optimization, targets specific peptide segments for accurate quantification. [33]Metaproteomics combines label-free quantification, chromatographic fractionation, and mass spectrometry, using Unipept and Krona software to analyze microbial community protein composition and species abundance [34]. 
Post-translational modification research covers glycosylation, ubiquitination, methylation, acylation, etc. Glycosylation is divided into N-and O-linked types. Technical routes include lectin-enriched N-glycopeptides (label-free combined with heavy water deglycosylation), motif antibody-enriched O-GlcNAc (4D label-free analysis), and ZIC-HILIC-enriched intact N-glycopeptides for glycan composition analysis [35-37]. The first involves a label-free approach, where N-glycopeptides are enriched using lectin affinity chromatography following enzymatic digestion. Subsequent deglycosylation with heavy water induces a mass shift, enabling detection via mass spectrometry. O-GlcNAc glycosylation analysis involves enzymatic digestion, enrichment with motif antibodies, and 4D-label-free mass spectrometry, followed by qualitative and quantitative analysis of modification sites. The second strategy involves intact N-glycopeptide analysis, where peptides are enriched using ZIC-HILIC chromatography after enzymatic digestion. This is followed by database searching and data analysis, allowing for the identification of modification sites, glycan compositions, and large-scale qualitative and quantitative analysis. Ubiquitination uses motif antibodies (K-ε-GG) to enrich peptides, with 4D label-free and mass spectrometry detecting a 114.1Da mass shift for site-specific analysis[38]. Methylation relies on motif antibody enrichment and 4D label-free analysis of molecular weight changes to precisely locate arginine/lysine methylation sites [39].Acylation uses antibody enrichment followed by TMT labeling (for acetylation) or 4D label-free detection of molecular weight shifts to analyze acylated peptides and their functional mechanisms [40].

2.4. Metabolomics
Metabolomics, a burgeoning "omics" field following genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, serves as an extension of the latter two, offering a more direct and precise reflection of an organism's physiological state. It constitutes a crucial component of systems biology. By investigating alterations in metabolites, metabolomics elucidates the roles and impacts of proteins within metabolic pathways, thereby reflecting the outcomes of gene expression and regulation[41].
The primary technical workflow in metabolomics research begins with the separation of target compounds from the sample. Subsequently, appropriate methods are employed for metabolite extraction; for instance, global metabolomics often utilizes a combined extraction approach for hydrophilic metabolites and lipids. Prior to instrumental analysis, quality control (QC) measures are implemented to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the instrument and the detection process. Following this, gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) separation techniques are used to finely separate the complex sample mixture, providing distinct sample components for subsequent mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Mass spectrometry, with its high sensitivity and specificity, then precisely identifies and quantifies each component. The acquired data undergoes filtering to eliminate invalid or interfering data, ensuring data quality and reliability, followed by qualitative and quantitative analysis[42].

2.5. Epigenomics
Epigenomics explores heritable genome modifications like DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and RNA methylation that regulate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, revealing the dual mechanisms of genetic information storage in both sequences and modifications [43].For DNA methylation, Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) uses bisulfite to convert unmethylated cytosines to uracil, enabling single-base methylation mapping via high-throughput sequencing. The process includes DNA extraction, fragmentation, bisulfite conversion, and library preparation[44-45].Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) enriches CCGG site-containing fragments via MspI digestion, covering 12% of the genome's methylation sites (over 80% of promoter regions) after bisulfite treatment, ideal for clinical CpG island methylation studies[46].Bisulfite Amplicon Sequencing (BSAS) allows targeted PCR amplification of specific genes or CpG islands, enabling absolute methylation quantification with as little as 1ng of sample [47].For chromatin accessibility and RNA methylation, ATAC-seq uses Tn5 transposase to cleave open chromatin regions, creating sequencing libraries to map nuclear chromatin accessibility, which can be combined with RNA-seq to study gene regulatory networks[48].MeRIP-seq enriches m6A-methylated RNA fragments (around 100nt) using m6A antibodies to profile m6A modification distribution across the transcriptome[49].ChIP-seq enriches DNA regions with histone modifications or transcription factor binding via chromatin immunoprecipitation, detecting genome-wide interaction sites[50-51].

 3. Quality Management in Biobanking
3.1. Multimodal Biospecimen Collections and Storage
The pre-processing of biological samples is a key component in the construction of high-quality biospecimen repositories, and its standardized implementation faces a number of challenges. The first problem is that potential bias in sample collection may lead to systematic errors, especially when multimodal samples are collected from the same patient, which may aggravate the physical and mental burden of the patient and lead to a decrease in the sample acquisition rate. In addition, the time-dependent degradation of endogenous biomolecules in isolated samples severely restricts the reliability of downstream analyses, and it requires some quality control methods to ensure the sample quality. To this end, this study constructs a clinical diagnosis and treatment-sample bank synergistic framework to break through the bottleneck of quality control through systematic strategies.
The standardised procedure based on the clinical pathway is as follows（Figure3）: after diagnosis and admission to the hospital, patients should sign the standardised ‘Informed Consent for Biological Sample Donation’ voluntarily on the premise of being fully informed. The sample collection time window must strictly follow the diagnosis and treatment sequence. In the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, for example, after the patient is diagnosed and before any therapeutic interventions are carried out, the hospital will collect the first biological sample to be sent to the Laboratory Department for testing, and the biospecimen bank can collect the samples required by the bank synchronously, which effectively avoids the trouble caused by the second collection to the patient. Throughout the treatment cycle, the biospecimen repository needs to work closely with the clinical collection to collect dynamic samples, covering the entire spectrum of biospecimens from the initial diagnosis to the end of treatment. The collection of various types of samples needs to be prepared and pre-treated according to the type of downstream experiments. After obtaining clinical samples, it is recommended that the samples be de-identified and labelled in order to protect patients' personal information. In addition, it is recommended to collect 2-3 additional samples for distribution according to the sample volume requirements of the above-mentioned groups. Regarding sample transport, it needs to be carried out under temperature monitoring according to environmental conditions and experimental requirements. In addition, all biological samples need to undergo quality testing, including tissue sample quality, DNA quality, RNA quality and protein quality, before depositing into the biosample bank. This well-thought-out sample management programme provides a reliable guarantee for the research and maximizes the effective use of the samples.

Figure3: The typical workflow for oncologic inpatient cohorts based on 3M framework.
 3.1.1. Tissue
To minimize tissue warm ischemia time, tissue samples should be collected and processed within 30 minutes of gross specimen excision [52-53] . Processing involves rinsing the excised tissue samples with sterile, nuclease-free saline or PBS to remove surface blood. The tissue should then be dissected into smaller pieces and aliquoted for storage to minimize freeze-thaw cycles. It is important to note that these tissue samples may be derived from "residual tissue" from surgical specimens, or from biopsies obtained via minor surgery, endoscopy, or ultrasound guidance. The order of collection should be as follows: normal tissue (N: >5 cm from the tumor margin), adjacent tissue (P: 2-3 cm from the tumor margin), and tumor tissue (T)[54-57].
For fresh frozen samples, provide an adequate amount of tissue while ensuring sufficient material for pathological examination. Processed tissue samples should be stored in 2 mL RNase-free screw-cap cryovials, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 h, and then transferred to -80°C or liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. If immediate processing is not possible, flash-freezing should be performed within approximately 3 hours of storage at 4°C. Certain omics applications require the use of preservation solutions. For example, when using RNAlater, add a volume five times that of the tissue, store at 4°C overnight, and then transfer to -80°C for applications such as transcriptomic sequencing. For preservation with Miltenyi tissue storage solution, add a volume five times that of the tissue and transport to the laboratory within 24 hours at 4°C for applications such as single-cell sequencing. For paraffin-embedded samples, fixation in 10% buffered formalin (preferably neutral buffered formalin) should occur within approximately 3 hours of surgical resection. The fixation time is typically 24-48 hours. Embedded tissues can be stored at room temperature or 4°C.
3.1.2. Blood
Blood samples should be processed within 2 hours whenever possible. If immediate processing is not feasible, samples should be stored at 4°C for less than 24 hours[58-59], . For serum or plasma, processing (centrifugation, separation, aliquoting, and freezing) must occur within 4 hours of collection. It is recommended to store processed blood samples in multiple aliquots to avoid quality degradation due to repeated freeze-thaw cycles. After collection, anticoagulant blood should be gently inverted to mix, centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes, and the plasma aliquoted into cryovials, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 hours, and stored at -80°C. After collection of procoagulant blood, allow it to clot at room temperature (15-25°C) for 0.5 hours [60] , centrifuge at 2000g for 10 minutes[61] , and collect the supernatant (serum). Aliquot the serum into cryovials, flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 hours, and store at -80°C long-term. Discard the final 500 μl to avoid platelet and cellular contamination[62] . Hemolysis, the presence of insoluble flocculent material, or turbidity in the blood sample are considered non-compliant, and re-sampling is recommended. 
The choice of blood collection tube type should be based on the experimental objectives, downstream analysis requirements, and sample stability. In metabolomics, serum is considered the gold standard due to the absence of anticoagulant interference, particularly for amino acid metabolite detection. Heparin/EDTA plasma tubes can be used as alternatives, but it is important to note that heparin interferes with DNA studies and EDTA affects NMR signals[63-65] Proteomics studies require special consideration: serum can reflect changes in coagulation-related proteins, while EDTA plasma can inhibit protease activity, which is beneficial for the stability of sensitive proteins such as phosphatases. Although citrate tubes reduce platelet activation, the dilution effect caused by the liquid anticoagulant may affect the accuracy of protein concentrations [66-67] . For transcriptomics, PAXgene tubes (for rapid RNA stabilization) or EDTA tubes (to inhibit RNase release) are preferred; the latter is more suitable for large-scale clinical studies but requires controlled sample exposure time [68]。
3.1.3 Urine
Prior to urine sample collection, donors should be instructed to thoroughly cleanse or disinfect the urethral opening. Following collection, a visual inspection of the urine sample should be performed to assess its suitability, specifically checking for contaminants such as fecal matter. Midstream urine samples should be collected from each donor in the morning before breakfast (5:00-8:00 AM) [69-71] . Samples should be centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 hours, and then stored at -80°C. Samples that cannot be processed in a timely manner should also be placed in 4 ℃ <48h, at room temperature (22 ℃ or so) <3h, to avoid ice packs and room temperature transport more than 8h, -20 ℃ <2 weeks, the number of freezing and thawing ≤ 3 times [72-75]
3.1.4. Saliva
Saliva samples should be collected between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM [76-79] . Donors should rinse their mouths with purified water 2 hours before sampling to remove oral debris. Following this, donors should refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, or brushing their teeth. A sterile cotton swab should be placed under the donor's tongue, and the saliva-soaked swab should be removed every 1 minute, repeated four times. Subsequently, the saliva should be extracted from the cotton swab using a disposable syringe. The samples should then be centrifuged at 4°C at 2600g for 15 minutes [80] to remove any debris. The supernatant from each sample should be aliquoted into cryovials, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 hours, and stored at -80°C until use [81-82] . Samples should be frozen as soon as possible after sampling, and if freezing conditions cannot be met, they should be <1h at room temperature, <6h at 2-8°C, and ≤4 weeks at -20°C. [83-85]。
3.1.5. Feces
Feces were collected within 24 hours prior to endoscopy [86] Fresh specimens are essential. Before collection, participants were instructed to void their bladders and, whenever possible, to use a squat toilet. Fecal matter was collected into a clean, dry fecal collection tube and transferred to a sterile container within 30 minutes. Using a sterile spatula, the middle portion of the fecal sample was collected[87] . Following collection, samples were aliquoted and stored at 4°C. The collected samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 0.5 hours and then stored at -80°C. Fecal samples should be stored temporarily at -20°C or 4°C for <8 weeks or <12h, respectively[88-89] , and at room temperature for <4h [90]。
3.2. Sample Aliquoting
The collection and processing of multi-omics samples should strictly adhere to established sample volume guidelines. To ensure the smooth progression of the research, we recommend collecting an additional 2-3 aliquots of each sample as backups and storing them using an aliquotting strategy. This backup strategy effectively addresses potential unforeseen circumstances during sample storage, transportation, or usage, such as sample degradation due to temperature fluctuations or leakage caused by improper handling. In the event of such incidents, the intact backup samples can be promptly utilized to prevent delays in research progress caused by a single problematic sample, thereby ensuring the seamless execution of the entire research endeavor. This robust sample management protocol provides a reliable safeguard for the research, minimizing experimental risks.
3.3. Sample transport
Refrigerated samples (i.e., samples stored at 2-8°C) require the use of biological ice packs to maintain their storage temperature range during transport. For samples that require cryopreservation, dry ice or liquid nitrogen must be used for protected transport. It is recommended to store the samples at 2-8°C before centrifugation and dispensing, and no freezing is allowed [75] . When using dry ice for transport, the amount of dry ice should be reasonably arranged according to the length of the transport: 2 kg of dry ice can maintain the low-temperature environment for ≤6 h, 5 kg of dry ice can maintain ≤24 h, and 8 kg of dry ice can maintain ≤48 h,taking into account that the temperature is high in the summer, the amount of dry ice should be increased to 1.5 times of the original. In order to prevent the dry ice from crushing and damaging the samples, it is recommended to use powdered, rod-shaped dry ice, and brick-shaped dry ice can be smashed with a hammer for transport. In addition, to ensure the safety of the samples, all samples placed in dry ice should be placed in self-sealing bags on the outer packaging and clearly labelled for easy identification and tracking. It should be emphasised that, to ensure the safety and integrity of the samples, it is strictly prohibited to transport samples loose inside the dry ice.
4. Quality Control (QC)
4.1. Sample sampling
To ensure the reliability of sample quality, it is recommended that strict quality control measures be implemented throughout the entire process of sample collection to use. It is recommended to establish a QC system based on risk analysis with reference to ISO 20387 (ISO 20387:2018 ‘General Requirements for Biological Sample Banks’). Regular quality sampling of samples should be carried out, with small batch sampling (accounting for 2%-5% of the total volume of the sample bank) on a monthly basis and comprehensive sampling (accounting for 10%-15%) every six months; when the sample bank undergoes a major environmental change, introduces a new method or has abnormal results, targeted sampling will be carried out in a timely manner; and the scope of the test covers the quality of proteins, nucleic acids and tissue samples. For samples that fail to meet the standards, they should be destroyed according to ISO 35001 (ISO 35001:2019 ‘Requirements for biosafety management systems’), and destruction records should be completed. Through regular sampling and standardised management, the integrity of the samples and the reliability of the research data can be effectively guaranteed to ensure the smooth implementation of scientific research.
4.1.1 Tissue sample quality testing
Cellular activity is often measured by using Taipan blue staining, and the activity score should be >80% to meet the requirements. If the activity score is lower than this standard, it can be considered to use the appropriate technology to remove the dead cells to achieve the enrichment of cells, so as to improve the overall activity level of the sample. However, when the necrosis rate of the tissue is greater than 20%-50%, due to the high percentage of dead cells, it may cause serious interference with subsequent studies or assays, and such tissues can usually be directly discarded [91-92]。
For the detection of tumour cell content, the percentage of tumour cells in tumour tissues can be effectively assessed using HE staining. When the proportion of tumour cells in the tumour tissue is >65% [93] the sample is judged to be qualified. 
4.1.2 DNA Quality Testing
DNA quality testing is similar in principle and procedure to RNA quality testing. Firstly, the concentration and purity of DNA is determined by quantitative method based on UV absorbance using a spectrophotometer. The absorbance ratio of OD260/OD280 is the key index to measure the purity of DNA, and when the ratio reaches 1.8, it means that the DNA is in a relatively pure state[92, 94-95] . Secondly, the integrity of DNA was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Intact genomic DNA will show tight bands with high molecular weight characteristics during electrophoresis, and there is basically no or very little low molecular weight trailing phenomenon. The presence of trailing or diffuse bands in the electrophoresis result is an indication that the DNA has been degraded or broken. This result provides a visual basis for determining the suitability of sample handling and storage conditions for downstream molecular experiments to ensure the quality of the DNA used in the experiments.
4.1.3 RNA Quality Assay
RNA quality assessment focuses on purity and integrity, both of which determine the usability of RNA samples in biological experiments. Spectrophotometry is the key method in purity detection. Its principle is based on the characteristic absorption of nucleic acids at 260 nm and proteins at 280 nm, and the purity is judged by calculating the OD260/280 ratio. Typically, a ratio between 1.8 and 2.2 indicates a high purity of the RNA sample. However, this method does not directly reflect the integrity of the RNA and makes it difficult to identify other impurities. The choice of buffer for the measurement is equally important; Tris or TE buffers are superior to water in providing a stable OD260/280 ratio. To compensate for the shortcomings of spectrophotometry, there is a trend towards a multi-wavelength OD synthesis judgement strategy covering wavelengths of 240 nm and 320 nm, which are used to capture potential contaminants and background absorption information, respectively. Analysing the changes of OD260/240 and OD260/320 ratios can identify other contaminants in the samples in depth, thus enhancing the accuracy of RNA sample quality assessment and providing reliable support for subsequent biological experiments [92, 95]。
For integrity assessment, the RNA integrity value (RIN) assay is the core tool, which utilises microfluidic capillary electrophoresis to obtain RIN values ranging from 1 (fully degraded) to 10 (fully intact). Typically, a RIN≥7 is considered the critical threshold, reflecting the overall quality of the RNA. RNA extracted from fresh tissues usually exhibits higher RIN values, whereas RIN values of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues tend to be concentrated in the range of 2-5, which affects the success rate of RNA-seq experiments. Therefore, factors such as sample storage time, environmental conditions and fixation time need to be considered in experimental planning to ensure the accuracy and reliability of experimental results [96-98].
4.1.4 Protein Quality Assay
BCA protein assay kit (using bovine serum albumin as the standard) is used to determine the protein concentration, by measuring the absorbance of the sample at a specific wavelength, and calculating the protein concentration according to the standard curve, in the assay can be used to eliminate interfering substances in the BCA protein assay by using the DOC and TCA to precipitate proteins, so as to improve the accuracy and reliability of the quantification of proteins[99] . Using the traditional method of Western blot to detect protein quality, if the specific bands of the target protein can be detected, and the bands are clear and without obvious trailing or dispersion, it indicates that the extracted proteins are not degraded, and the quality of the proteins is good [100]。
4.2. Ethical security
The long-term development of a biosample bank needs to strike a balance between scientific value and ethical compliance, and all samples and data collection should be carried out after obtaining the informed consent of the donor, in order to protect the rights and interests of both the donor and the collector and avoid legal disputes. The informed consent form should be signed with respect to the donor's wishes, religious beliefs and cultural level, ensuring that it is signed in a sober, fair, uncoerced and fully understood manner, and in a written form that specifies the rights and responsibilities of both parties, and is completed prior to the collection of the samples and permanently stored [101]. Despite the initial establishment of the informed consent framework, there are still pitfalls in its practical application, e.g., is there harm to the patient during the sampling process, the magnitude of that harm, and is there compensation? Does the patient have sufficient informed consent? Is it ethical to collect the sample? Biological sample safety or data security issues and privacy concerns.
According to the definition of harm in Munshi's study [102] , the sampling and testing operations of the biobank did not involve behaviours that could cause harm to patients, and all related costs were borne by the biobank, without infringing on the economic interests of patients, and secondly, after the implementation of the standardised synergistic operation plan between clinical treatment and the biobank, the psychological and physical burden of secondary sampling on patients was also avoided. Secondly, after the implementation of the standardised synergistic operation programme between clinical treatment and biobanks, the psychological and physical burden of secondary sampling on patients is avoided. For this kind of social welfare behaviour of donating samples to biobanks, although the final results of the study are contributed to the society, the patients cannot directly benefit from the relevant research, so the biobanks should still give appropriate compensation for this kind of public welfare behaviour, which can help to attract more people to participate in the donation[103] . When obtaining patients' informed consent for biobanking, differences in individual comprehension and age need to be taken into account to ensure effective communication, especially for vulnerable groups, biobanks should develop easy-to-understand protocols, such as using colloquial expressions and avoiding jargon. For patients who do not have the right to make autonomous decisions (e.g. children), their legal guardians may sign on their behalf[104-106]. The information kept in biospecimen repositories covers clinical profile data, biomaterial data and demographic data. When dealing with data or samples that contain personal privacy, donors' concerns about the exposure of private information may affect their willingness to participate. Therefore, before obtaining informed consent, it is necessary to explain in detail to the target individuals the de-identification protection measures of the biospecimen repository for their personal information in order to eliminate their concerns and enhance their willingness to participate [107-108]. To ensure the safety of biological samples and related data, all activities of the biospecimen repository should be carried out under the strict review and supervision of the ethics committee. Especially when it comes to the use of biological samples, such as the export of samples collected in China to foreign countries, there must be justifiable reasons to ensure that all processes are legal and compliant, and the entire process is subject to the supervision of the ethics committee[109-110].
5. Integrated management of biospecimen repositories
5.1. Biobank Management
Biobank management covers the whole life cycle of samples, and its core process includes standardised inbound and outbound management mechanism. In the admission process, the applicant (clinical department/project leader) should first submit the ‘Application for Biological Sample Admission’ and supporting materials such as research proposal, and then enter the approval process after the sample bank comprehensively evaluates the scientific value, ethical compliance and feasibility of the project; for the approved project, the applicant should further submit the standardised collection plan (including the details of collection, transportation and handling), and sign an ‘Agreement on Admission’ with the sample bank to clarify the implementation of informed consent and the process of consumables receipt; in the final process, both parties will jointly verify the samples and sign a standardised admission and discharge mechanism. The applicant shall further submit a standardised collection plan (including collection and transportation and handling rules) and sign the ‘Agreement on Accession’ with the sample bank to specify the implementation of informed consent and the process of consumables collection; in the final stage, both parties shall jointly verify the sample information and complete the ‘Registration Form for Accession’, which shall be digitally archived according to the coding rules of ‘Hospital Code + Organ Code + Water Number + Specimen category + Tube Section Number’, and the samples which do not pass the audit will be issued with the ‘Notice of Rejection’, which will state the specific reasons. With regard to the process of release, the applicant should submit the ‘Release Application Form’ with departmental approvals and ethical approvals 14 working days in advance, and after reviewing the significance of the research and compliance by the sample bank, the project that passes the audit needs to sign the ‘Release Agreement’ to define the relationship between rights and responsibilities, and then the staff locates and verifies the target samples and collaborates with the applicant to confirm the information in the inventory and simultaneously completes the signing of the ‘Release Registration Form’ and the handover of the entity. In order to guarantee the effectiveness of sample use tracking, the applicant is required to submit a sample application progress report 1/3/6 months after the release of samples, forming a closed-loop management to continuously optimise the allocation of resources in the database.
5.2. Metadata Management 
Metadata management integrates patients' clinical data (case system collection and follow-up records) and histological data through a unified identifier system to ensure the uniqueness of the association between the biospecimen bank and the database. In the process of data accession, firstly, the data demand department submits the ‘Application for Data Accession to the Biospecimen Bank’ (the data associated with the already accessed samples can be exempted from application, but the application should be submitted for the case of signing the informed consent form without actually donating the samples); subsequently, the management personnel of the biospecimen bank conducts a comprehensive assessment of the scientific research value of the project, the reasonableness of the data, and the accessibility of the data, and issues the ‘Notice of Rejection of Data Accession’ with an explanation of the reasons if the data passes the audit. If the data do not pass the audit, the ‘Notice of Rejection of Data Entry’ will be issued and the reasons will be explained; the data that pass the audit will be entered into the database in strict accordance with the specifications, and the data will be sorted and filed and filled in the ‘Biological Sample Database Data Entry Registration Form’ after the completion of the audit, and the whole process will be carried out through the review of the legality of data and ethical compliance. The management of data release requires the user department to submit the ‘Application for Data Release from the Biological Sample Bank’ with ethical approvals, and in the process of audit, it is necessary to go through the double checking of the department of data source and the biological sample bank (including the matching of data and samples, and the assessment of the research value and feasibility); if the data do not pass the audit, the ‘Notice of Rejection of Data Release’ will be issued; after the audit is passed, the staff will organise the data according to the requirements and archive the data, and the data will be ultimately transferred to the database through on-site copying or encrypted transmission by the personnel designated by the applicant. After passing the audit, the staff will arrange the data according to the requirements and archive them, and finally the applicant will designate the personnel to obtain the data through on-site copying or encrypted transmission, and at the same time, fill in the Data Release Registration Form to complete the handover.
6. Conclusion
The rapid advancement of omics technologies has significantly accelerated discoveries in precision medicine, while simultaneously imposing higher demands on biobanking infrastructure. These imperatives have driven the establishment of standardized protocols for multi-omics-oriented specimen repositories. However, existing reviews rarely provide practical comprehensive frameworks to lower the complexity of biobank development for researchers. This study systematically characterizes the technical specifications of major omics platforms, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics, and proposes a standardized reference system for minimum sample requirements in multi-omics analyses. These findings provide critical guidance for designing multi-omics specimen collection workflows.
Furthermore, the operational efficacy of biobanks fundamentally relies on the systematic integration of clinical pathways with specimen acquisition processes. This necessitates predefined critical time points for sample collection, and multidisciplinary collaboration to establish quality control systems spanning the entire workflow. Pre-collection procedures require ethical approval and informed consent documentation, intra-collection phase demands protocol optimization, while post-collection processes emphasize specimen quality assurance and metadata management. Through process-specific optimizations implemented in hospital settings, we have validated this framework's clinical applicability. Importantly, our open-source management framework named as “3M” (multi-omics, multimodal biospecimen, multi-departments) (available at [URL]) enables rapid community adoption and facilitates standardization efforts.
